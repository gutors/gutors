## Hi there 👋
My name is Gustavo Schmid de Jesus, I'm a software engineer with passion for building systems that have an impact and help other people.

I'm a Brazilian currently living at Maceió city, right next to the beach!

Ex companies: Procempa, NSCAD, Mconf

## About Me
I have most of my experience working with Java applications for the public sector of my hometown city Porto Alegre.
There I helped deliver software that helped my colleagues and fellow citizens to save money and improve their day to day work.

I recently travelled to SouthEast Asia for the last 2 years, and during that time I had the benefit of knowing some amazing people from different parts of the world. This experience teached me the value of learning from others, especially from people that come from different backgrounds and diverse cultures.
